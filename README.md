# Quantum Variational Dynamics Engine (QVDE) – Demo

This repository contains a simple demonstration of the Quantum Variational Dynamics Engine concept.

## Idea
The project explores learning as an energy-driven dynamic process instead of static parameter optimization.

## Demo
The script simulates a system whose energy decreases over time, representing convergence toward stability.

## How to Run

Create a virtual environment:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

    pip install numpy matplotlib

Run the demo:

    python demo.py

The script generates `output.png`, which shows energy decreasing over time.

## Purpose
This demo illustrates the core idea behind the QVDE framework in a simple and visual way.
