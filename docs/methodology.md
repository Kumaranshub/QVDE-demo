# Methodology

The Quantum Variational Dynamics Engine (QVDE) models scientific data as trajectories in a high-dimensional energy landscape rather than as static points.

The system integrates concepts from:

• Variational Optimization
• Dynamical Systems Theory
• Hamiltonian Mechanics
• Information Geometry
• Spectral Graph Methods

The simulation pipeline:

1. Input dataset is embedded into a continuous manifold.
2. A variational energy functional is defined over this manifold.
3. Gradient-based updates evolve system states in time.
4. Trajectories are tracked as phase-space paths.
5. Stability, attractors, and bifurcations are analyzed.

The engine therefore interprets data processing as a physical evolution process rather than a purely statistical one.
