The QVDE simulation demonstrates that treating data as a dynamical system produces observable trajectory structures.

Key observations:

• Convergence occurs along stable manifolds
• Clusters emerge as energy minima
• Transitional states appear as saddle points
• Noise behaves as stochastic perturbation forces

The simulation video illustrates these phenomena visually, reinforcing the interpretation of learning as a physical evolution process.

This supports the hypothesis that variational physics frameworks can provide richer insights than static data embeddings.
