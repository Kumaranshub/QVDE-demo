# Future Work

Future development of the Quantum Variational Dynamics Engine may include:

• Integration with quantum circuit simulators
• GPU-accelerated numerical solvers
• Higher-dimensional phase-space embeddings
• Real-time interactive simulations
• Experimental validation on real scientific datasets

The long-term goal is to develop a unified physics-driven framework for machine learning and scientific data interpretation.
